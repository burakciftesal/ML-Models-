🧠 Machine Learning Playground (Work in Progress)
Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects Repository, a growing collection of hands-on experiments, mini-projects, and applied research using both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.

This repository is in its early stages — currently containing two projects — and will be actively developed over time as I explore more advanced topics, improve implementations, and experiment with real-world data.

🚧 What's Inside (so far)
1. Supervised Learning: SHAP + XGBoost on scRNA-seq
Using explainable machine learning to understand immune cell identity from gene expression
📁 pbmc-xgboost-shap/
🔬 XGBoost classifier trained on Leiden clusters
📊 SHAP used to interpret feature contributions

2. Unsupervised Learning: KMeans Customer Segmentation
Clustering customers based on behavior metrics
📁 customer-segmentation/
📉 PCA + KMeans with visualization
📌 Silhouette analysis and cluster profiling

🛠 Tech Stack
Languages: Python

Core Libraries:
pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, xgboost, shap, umap-learn, seaborn

Jupyter Notebooks for interactive experimentation

🧩 What's Next?
The goal is to iteratively build a well-organized ML portfolio, including:

🔜 Deep learning (e.g., Autoencoders, CNNs, LSTMs)

🔜 Time series forecasting (Prophet, ARIMA)

🔜 Dimensionality reduction comparisons (UMAP, PCA, t-SNE)

🔜 Anomaly detection projects

🔜 Production-ready pipelines (MLflow, joblib, streamlit apps)
